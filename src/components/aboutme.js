          My name is Brandon Chao. 24 year old born and raised in Boston, Ma.
          Got my GED and went to UMass Boston to study exercise and health
          sciences. Have done odds jobs such as an electrician apprentice and
          meter maid. Decided to learn how to code at the start of the pandemic,
          and after many tutorials and free classes on Youtube, here I am today
          just looking to advance my future and career.
